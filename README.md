# 2019-Summer-Java
This summer at ATDP Berkeley, I took a Java course where I learnt the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. The course was AP-aligned and taught me many important concepts related to programming in Java. I won 3rd place for a project I made using geometric shapes. Using different colored polygons, I created a horse with a sunset in the background. In addition, I also won 2nd place for the final project. I created a representation of Crossy Road with an animated chicken and endless rows of roads with moving cars and trucks.
