# 2019-Summer-Java
Took "Programming in Java" course at ATDP Berkely.
<br />
I learnt the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. The course was AP-aligned and taught me many important concepts related to programming in Java.
<br />
I won 3rd place for a project I made using geometric shapes. Using different colored polygons, I created a horse with a sunset in the background.
<br />
I also won 2nd place for the final project. I created a representation of Crossy Road with an animated chicken and endless rows of roads with moving cars and trucks.
